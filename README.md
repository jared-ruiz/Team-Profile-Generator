## Weekly Reflection
---

This assignment tested my endurance. There was so much to think about and so much to consider when creating this application that I almost got overwhelmed. I learned a lot about how files are created using 'fs' and promises, and the route I took with creating the actual html was an interesting experience as well, given the fact that I had not touched html or css in quite some time it feels. I did my best to stick close to the criteria and made sure everything functioned as intended. The challenges are getting very difficult and It's requiring more and more time and sleepless nights to get them done. I'm fully capable of learning, the pace is rough but at the end of this, I will have a decent grasp on most things I will need to start getting me off the ground. It's motivating! Here's to another week!
